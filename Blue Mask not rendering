Hi, I was messing around with my skin settings, then next time I logged on to Wynncraft, my blue mask was not rendering
even though i was wearing it, I am playing on version 1.8.6, I checked to see if hats were off, they were on,
did /hub then relogged, nothing, I tried putting on other helmets and they rendered in, (class archer) I talked 
to another player, and put on their blue mask, it did not render either... we traded back, I did not know what to do.
I reinstalled minecraft completely, I am here for help so you can make my Blue mask actaully render in, it was not
visible for other players

My ign is: StoryStudio

I am new to Github, so I could not figure out how to add screenshots.
